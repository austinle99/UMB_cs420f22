 CS420: Theory to Computation

Introduction to theoretical aspects of computing including models of computation, inherent limits on computation, and feasible computation. 
Topics covered:
• finite automata (deterministic, nondeterministic, pushdown)
• regular expressions
• context-free grammars
• decidability
• computable functions (recursive functions, functions computable by Turing machines, functions computable in a programming language)
• insolvability of the halting problem and related problems.
